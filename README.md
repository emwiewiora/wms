# wms
warehouse management system


This is my learning/passion project.
I have been working with a WMS for 2 years and the system fasinates me.  I also love databases and this will heavily rely on one.
SO.... here goes.

This project is built on the MERNG stack:
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- GraphQL

It also uses:
- Apollo server
- Mongoose
